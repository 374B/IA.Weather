There are two ways to run the API

- WebHost
- SelfHost

By default the Web application (front end) is configured to talk to the SelfHost API. The required projects for this should run automatically.

Notes:
	Exception handling is lacking in certain areas
	Some models/DTOS are also lacking in certain areas (no SOC)
	There are tests however not everything is tested. The tests that are written should demonstrate enough
	There are a bunch of other TODOS scattered throughout the code
